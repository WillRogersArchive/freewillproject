> "Everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects." — Will Rogers

## Overview

The "Free Will" Project aims to create a definitive, accessible digital archive of Will Rogers' public domain works. This repository contains meticulously transcribed content to support both casual readers and academic research.

## Purpose

Will Rogers (1879-1935) was America's most prominent humorist and social commentator during the early 20th century. Despite his cultural significance, Rogers' work is seriously underrepresented in the modern digital humanities landscape. The "Free Will" Project aims to fill this gap by creating an authoritative open-access collection that preserves Rogers' authentic voice, including spelling and stylistic choices.

## Repository Structure

Note: This repository is still in development. The structure may change as the project evolves.
