ALL high class Literary Lizzards when they start assembling a book have some fellow that is better known than they are to dash off a kind of an introduction, Well I was afraid if I had someone do that they would just be liable to say something funny And out side of the book being SHORT the one thing I guarantee it to be free from is humor, I dont want anybody spoiling the Book with some Komical remarks,

Besides I carry my own introductions with me, For I figure that no man can give you as good a boost as you can give yourself,

I would not have written this Book but My Publishers (get that, my Publishers) Harper and Brothers, (by mentioning their name they wont cut this out) Big firms love advertising just as much as us little punks do,

*My Publishers asked me to write another Book as they had a sale on the last one, (Which was called Will Rogers on the Peace Conference) Dont hurt to slip in a little Add for yourself once in awhile Especially when it is done in a clever way like this and dont look like one,*

They said write another book as we have traced the sale of the last one, And the fellow who bought it has a friend in the same institution, And we feel sure we can double the sale of your last book with this one,

In tracing this sale they found the party who bought the book was the same one who voted annually for Bryan, And his friend who we hope to land as a prospective purchaser, Holds the proud distinction of being the only man in the United States who found no fault with Burleson,

I said to them what will I write about, And they said by all means pick out a subject that is different, Something that nobody else has written on, Get something where you have no opposition, Well I started to thinking, then one night it came to me, I give you my word I had not heard a word about it, neither had I read anything in any papers about it, I dont know myself how I happened to think of it, But I got right up and wired my Publishers

"Have-hit-on-just-the-thing,-an-original subject,-PROHIBITION"

Aint it wonderful how I just happened to hit on this out of the way subject, and Title, Of course a writer must not let his Title interfere with what he is writing about, Look at that Spaniard he wrote a Book called the "Four Horse men of the Apothecary" I read it plum through and there wasent a thing about Horses or Drug Stores or anybody riding, In fact there is no town or Country on the map where these four fellows are supposed to come from, Then he has another book called Blood and Sand and its all about Horses and Cattle,

Now the Title of this little Gem of Free Thought is PROHIBITION But I will be like the Spaniard, The more I can keep my readers away from the Title, And keep them just on the opposite from the Title (about 95 proof) why the more chance I got getting away with it,

I want also to regretfully announce that this Book is not subsidized by any Liquor Concern,

**You wont find the Country any drier than this Book,**

All Stage rights of material in this Book reserved for Senators and Congressmen to tell at Chautauquas as original,

*Want to thank Proffessor Lowell of Harvard for the English Translation*

Want also to thank the Writers of the Old and new Testament for furnishing facts for some of my strongest Arguments against Prohibition,
