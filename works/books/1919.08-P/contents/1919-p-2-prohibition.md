NOW before I start in I want it distinctly understood I dont knock Prohibition through any personal grudge as I do not drink myself, But I do love to play to an audience who have had a few nips, just enough so they can see the joke and still sober enough to applaud it,

You all who have had no experience have no Idea of the difference, the Prohibitionists just seem to be sore on the World,

How they got the thing through, Senators and Congressmen were all in Washington waiting for the next pay day, When one member come in and says lets vote on Prohibition, The others all said, Why we cant vote on Prohibition our people back home dident tell us to come here and vote Prohibition, The old desciple of Bryan democracy that had proposed it says No I know they dident tell us to vote on it but its a good day and I just feel like voting on something,

So they sent around to all the various Bars in Washington and collected a quorum and voted everybody dry,

They did not know when they were doing it that they were killing off the thing that a Senator or Congressman holds dearer than anything in the World And that is an Audience in the Galleries in Washington, For no one ever goes to hear them any more, In fact no man living can sit in the Gallery and listen to them without a certain amount of Liquor in him,

They dident want to vote dry but they were so afraid of the way the Political Breeze seemed to be headed at the time, Never figuring it might change,

There is an old Legend that years ago there was a man elected to Washington who voted according to his own conscience,

Congressmens short sightedness is what put it through, then Bryan modestly claimed the credit,

They claim it was necessary to put it through as a war measure, how about this? Now France fought quite a bit in the war and trained on Wine, England did her part on Scotch and Polly and Ale, Canadian Club furnished its Quota from Canada, Italy Chiantied over the Alps into Austria, Womens clothes and Scotch Whiskey dident keep the Highlanders back much Guinnesses Stout kept the Irish fighting as usual, The American Troops dident retreat any further than you can run your hand in a **Paper Bag**, And they had been used to old Crow and Kentucky Bourbon, Russia was doing fine till some nut took their Vodka away from them and thay went back to look for it and nobody has ever heard of them since, Germany the Country with the smallest percentage of Alcahol in their National drink (which is beer) and Turkey who are totally prohibition, —why they lose the war,

Looks to me like if Germany and Turkey ever wanted to win a war they better start drinking a MANS SIZE DRINK,

Now a Prohibitionist is a man or woman, Who is so self satisfied with himself that he presents himself with a Medal, called the "CROIX DE PERFECT HE"

He gives himself this Medal because he is now going to start to meddle in everybodys business but his own,

Look at these `Towns` and `people` after Prohibition has hit them, Everybody looks like they had just had a puncture and no extra tire,

Streets that used to be lighted up at nights and thousands of people on them are now used for robbing purposes only,

If you drop into a Cafe after the Theater in a Prohibition town, They will wake up the Night watchman to cook you something,

Watch a crowd clustered around a couple of water pitchers in the center of the Table, They look like they had just heard the Kaiser had invaded Belgium again,

It will take some men two years solid rehersing to learn how to order a soft drink without blushing,

I knew one man in a dry town when he took his first Grape Juice high ball; it took three Doctors to revive him,

Somebody ought to get out a book **"How to learn to drink soft drinks in 20 lessons,"**

Soda Fountains will all have to go to the extra expense now of putting in a foot rail,

*There will be people among the coming generation that can name 12 different Phosphates that couldent name 2 Presidents,*

The first six ice cream sodas served to six pinockle players mean six more Bolshevikis,

One good thing in favor of the soda squirt bartender, His trade dont start coming in as early in the morning as the old hard stuff ones did,

The new ice cream dipper hound at the fountain will have another advantage over the old bartender, he wont have to listen to the same story over and over again,

*If prohibition will just stop some men trying to repeat stories they have heard, It will not have been in vain,*

Once they claim a fellow repeated a story he had heard and got it right, but this has never been verified,

If they will bring the ice cream into the drug stores in kegs instead of tins, They will make a lot of men seem more at home,

They will soon be listing Jamaica Ginger stock on the exchange,

They are trading Bethleham steel shares now for Peruna stock and paying the difference,

When a man drives up to a Gasoline filling station he will say, Give me 10 gallons in the tank and fill up this pint bottle,

The worst crime a child at home can commit now is to eat up the raisins that Dad brought home for fermenting purposes,

If I was California I would not claim the credit for making the wine they are serving nowadays,

Just look at the industries that will be put out of business, Getting bit by a snake will be a lost art,

You know no man is going to let a snake bite him after Liquor goes out,

Then there is the woman who used to faint and Brandy seemed to be the only thing that would revive her, now she will have to struggle along without fainting,

But the saddest case of all will be the loss of the Kentucky Colonel industry (They received their title through owning the widest brimmed black hat and having the largest Bourbon capacity of any man in the county Sah,)

> When they go to dig up his Mint bed, He will say just dig it a little deeper and I will get in myself, we are both nonessentials,

Of course on the other hand it has. introduced a lot of new methods especially in regard to getting it in to dry territory, There are people who if they put in half the time studying on some mechanical invention that they do how to smuggle in booze, Why they would be as great as Edison,

They put it in extra tires and even in the ones they were running on, One day a fellow had a couple of blow outs on the way into Oklahoma and lost all the profits,

But there is really only one successful way to bring it into dry territory and after all it is the most satisfactory, You drink it just before you get to the state line, in this way you are allowed to bring in all you can carry,

*I saw a box of Armours Meat drop off an express wagon and broke every bottle,*

Prohibition has done some very good things in the road building line, It has been the cause of more road improvement between dry and wet towns than any other thing,

If you want good roads leading out of your town vote it wet and the surrounding towns will fix up your roads,

Bad roads have broke more bottles of booze than the authorities,

The Prohibitionists put the bill through as a food saving device, And it has certainly been a success, Its made food so high people cant eat it,

The poorer people will have to go to Europe this summer to escape the high prices over here,

**It looks like we would have to have another war for things to get cheap like they used to be during the last one,**

And they still allow these Prohibitionists to eat, You know a drinking man he dont eat much and the more he drinks the less he eats but these Prohibitionists they just naturally ruin a meal,

Prohibitionists dispose of enough food just before speaking engagements to feed all the starving Armenians in the world,

The amount of time and energy consumed by Prohibitionists in speaking if put to a legitimate business would cut everybodys average work day down to 4 hours,

But the minute they get Prohibition they will hop on to something else it will be Cigarettes or room and bath, or something

See where they propose to stop Cigarettes first and then profanity, They are going to have a tough time with that profanity, cause as long as there is a prohibitionist living there will be profanity, !Z R-Z * ? ? Z I Z, ! R-R-R-Z ! ! !

You have seen millions and millions of dollars worth of Liberty Bonds sold in Cafes where everybody is drinking and jolly, Did you ever see any sold in an Ice cream Parlor,

The government said a man in Uniform couldent get a drink, Guess the government figured that the ones who dident have the nerve to go needed the liquor worse than the soldiers did,

Headlines in papers last year said **"Government stopped Brewries making beer"** The brewries had stopped making BEER years ago of their own accord,

*On account of the bartenders diluting the drinks people were ready for prohibition before they knew it,*

If they stall off Prohibition from July to january some bars will have to get another bottle of booze,

Mighty good thing we have had a nice warm winter this year or people would not have had any room in their Cellars for their coal,

Next winter there will be husbands tending to furnaces that never knew where they were before,

What is life without a cellar

If a residence gets on fire nowadays the fireman dont run to save the children or the valuables but to the cellar to save the booze,

There has been more underground building in the last year than there has been on top,

Prohibition has been a big saving for a lot of fellows. Where they used to have to go to the corner, now they only have to go down stairs,

If you ever see this add in the papers they would have to call out all the police reserves to keep back the applicants, "FOR SALE ONE HOUSE FULLY STOCKED,"

**Bout the only thing left for a poor man that cant afford his own house with a cellar is to move to a Republic,**

Personally I think the saloon men put this prohibition through as they have sold more in the last year than in any ten previous years before,

*Every time the Government would put on an extra tax the liquor people would put two extra on for themselves,*

Industries that switched to making ammunition during the war are now trying to see if they cant manufacture some drink called NO KICKO, or PRETTY NEAR O,

Everybody wonders what to do with the Kaiser, I think he should be brought over here and made to sample every soft drink made,

Maine and Kansas were the first Prohibition states, now look at them,

Maine was noted for two things, one was drinking awful whiskey and the other was shooting another hunter,

If it had not been for the hunting season in Maine and the early deaths from bad whiskey, Maine would have had a population now almost equal to Rhode Island,

The principal industry of Kansas was bootlegging,

The only way you could tell a **Citizen** from a **Bootlegger** in Kansas was the **Bootlegger** would be sober,

"There was so many bl nd P gs n Kansas for years that the Nat ve hog of that State today s born w thout eyes,"

The Booze they sold was so strong they had to dilute it with Alcahol,

Light Wines and Beers were as little known there, as Bevo is in a wet state,

Champaigne was as rare as a bathtub,

*The liquor was made from corn without either shucking or shelling it,*

This high explosive they used in the war called T N T, was originally Bootleg Whisky,

If a Bootlegger finds his supply running low he adds a hand full of Giant Powder and a few bottles of red ink and serves,

**If a state ever once goes dry it will stay, as there is enough Whisky peddlers to keep it voted that way,**

Imagine voting the Nation dry when the Allies owe all their success now to Haig and the Tanks,

They say the Tanks over there would go through anything, Well we have Tanks over here that have gone through all they ever had,

Convict in Toronto Canada waiting to be hung gave his guard some coffee, had a powder in it that put him to sleep and the fellow escaped, prohibitionists now use that against coffee drinking habit,

I just want to sight a case what a wrong prohibition coming into a country will do and the pleasures and amusements it will knock people out of seeing, I got a friend Bill Rice runs a Carnival Company had the first one of these diving girl shows, Well he went to a little town in Arizona to play and got all ready, dug the hole and put his tank in and was all ready for the water when they told him why there wasent that much water in the whole county, and was just about to crab the show when an old saloon man said he could fill it up with CORN WHISKY, it would look like water, so they did and that afternoon when the act went on Bill himself was the first out on the diving board, nobody up to then knew Bill could dive but he sho did, and went off that board mighty pretty but dident come up so they all waited and finally ran to the edge and looked over and there lay Bill high and dry on the bottom just sucking up the last that was in the tank, Now those people. away out there if prohibition had been in would have been denied that exhibition, and diving was an awful big novelty to them, and it also taught Bill a lesson, If he ever went back to Arizona again to get a bigger tank,

Did you know that a prohibitionist could be arrested for treason, Treason means anything that gives annoyance to your own people thereby giving aid to the enemy,

Outside of profiteers I cant think of anything that has given more annoyance,

**Prohibitionists are the originators of Camouflage, They made drinking look worse than it is,**

The minute prohibition goes in, I can see Cincinnatti ceceeding from the Union

Ohio was voted wet by the people and dry by their missrepresentatives,

She was supposed to go dry a month. ahead of the National ammendment She did that so it would give them a month to reherse in,

Pretty tough on the Columbus Ohio saloon men they have to close just when that big Methodist Conference meets there,

The minute Prohibition went in my friend Luke Mcgluke claimed exemption,

Billy Sunday (by the way I wonder what ever become of him) said when we get prohibition that there wont be any more jails, Kansas and Maine have more in them than out,

Another thing it wouldent be right by those jailers to throw them out of a job, those prohibitionists never have any regard for the other people Just think of it the minute we get prohibition hundreds and hundreds of jailers and guards are thrown out of work,

Of course the only way we have to prove anything is by the Bible, I find Genesis 9th Chapter 20 verse, "Noah began to be an Husbandman and planted a vineyard,"

*The minute he got to be a husband he started in right away to raise the necessary ingredients to make what goez with married life,*

Now Californians followed Noahs example, But fortunately in Noahs time there was no one to tell him he couldent have a vineyard,

**Why dont they pick on the Marrying thats in the same verse, why single out the poor old vineyard**

Next Verse "And he drank of the wine and was drunken and was within his tent"

Now here is what shows the prohibitionist up so bad, for Noah was a chosen man, If the lord dident punish him where do they come in to tell somebody what to do,

The prohibitionists rave about water, Now Noah knew more about water than all of them put togeather, He was the **WATER COMMISSIONER** of his time, He was an expert on water and the first man smart enough *not* to drink it,

*He was the first one to discover a use for it, that was to float a boat on, But as a beverage he knew it was a total failure,*

Now everything happens for the best through Noah partaking of too much wine, and going on this little spree is why the lord picked him to gather these Animals into the Ark, He was the only one who had ever seen them,

You see if Noah had not drank we would today perhaps be without menageries,

Other men of later generations have claimed that they have seen animals that Noah dident take on the ark, But perhaps their Vineyards too were of a different variety,

**Noah was told to collect two of every variety of animal and take them on board defy any man to show me where he took a prohibitionist and his mate aboard,**

The only thing we can liken in this day to the ark was the first commuting trip of the George Washington, There was two of every kind of peace deligate with the exception of the Republican, there was only one of that specie, as there seemed to be at that time no especial desire on the part of the organizers of the expedition to populate the earth in the future with that kind of animal, As they propogate very fast,

It is not even recorded in the history of the conference that they even landed there with this lone specimen, As theres been no mention made of him whatever,

In the next verse we find "Ham saw his father and told his bretheren"

There was the foundation of the first prohibitionist, butting in where he had no business,

*He made such a bad job out of it thats why all bad actors are called hams.*

In the next verse Noah awakes, puts a curse on Hams son Cannan, "and told him a servant of servants shall ye be"

Little did Noah think when he told him he would be a servant that some day servants would rule the house as they do today,

This wine had such ill effects on Noahs health that it was all he could do to live 950 years,

Just 19 years short of Methusalah who held the long distance age record of his and all time,

Show me a total abstainer that ever lived that long,

And on the 40th day Noah sent out a dove and unlike Bryans, Noahs came back,

Now later on in the 14 chapter when Abram was returning from victorious battle it says Melchizedek king of salem met them with bread and wine,

**What did we meet our victorious troops with Huylers Chocolate and spearmint chewing gum,**

Also, shows that no matter what a long name a king may have there is some good in him,

What did Moses say when he took all the philistines up on top of the mountain He said "Corinthians what will you have"

And Rebecca with the pitcher who was it told her "fillem up again"

You only hear wine spoken of in there and that is as it should be now, Light wines and Beers, that was what they had in Biblical days and that is what President Wilson says we should have, do away with the Hard Stuff, Also, can the saloons,

**They used to say, drive the saloons out of politics, Why not go further and drive politics out of Congress,**

I agree with the prohibitionists about doing away with Saloons and Whisky, But let people who want to, buy beer and light wines and take it to their homes and have it when they like,

*If they would make all these fat saloon owners go to work, that would solve the labor question,*

Doing away with saloons will certainly crab the diamond stud and ring industry, as about all other male species has gotten wise and quit wearing them,

President Wilson in his last note to the Americans said: Keep light wines and beers,

Many a politician now wishes he had had the nerve to have said the same thing,

Now are you going to follow Bryans advice or Pres Wilsons, I will string along with the one who has done something,

Simply take their two batting average, Pres Wilson has been right a lot of times But W J has yet to guess his first winner,

President says give us light wines and beers, if they can get beer any lighter than it is they will have to get a prop to hold it up,

Have to turn your glass upside down now to keep it from flying away,

After drinking a bottle of this weak beer you have to take a glass of water as a stimulant,

That is what they fill these dirigible baloons with now, its lighter than air,

You cant drink enough to get drunk on, But you can drink enough to fly,

That peculiar taste that beer has nowadays is the aniline dye they use to make it look like beer,

A bartenders apology goes with every bottle,

**The only thing heavy about wine is the price,**

There is a reward offered for a waiter that can make a cork pop like it used to,

Michigan has the natural ingredients of one of the best jags in the world, Take a bottle of any near beer and pour it over a bowl of grape nuts (michigans second commodity) eat this hurriedly then take a five mile ride over one of their roads in a Ford and you have as good results as any souse would want,

They talk of shipping it in dry territory in coffins, Why my state of Okla, did that years ago, the way they got on to them was, There had been more bodies shipped to this town than the combined population of the whole state, One man got rich breaking up the coffins and selling the lumber as a byproduct,

Now the bootleggers use aeroplanes to bring it in, The town marshal of my home Claremore Okla is rated as the leading Ace, he has brought down over 3000 quarts,

You dont have to go any farther than our best ancient writers to prove that prohibition was unnecessary, look at old OMAR KHAYHAM "The Pickled Philosopher of Persia" do you think Billy Sundays SLANG will live as long as Omars Philosophy has,

In that verse something about "a loaf of bread a jug of Wine and Thou," Look how they have jagged those three things up on him, Bread,--they voted wheat so high nobody can eat bread, Wine will soon be gone and the wine they have got, if it had ever been handed to Omar I would hate to have read his book, Thou―I guess he meant a woman, Well she has the vote and she aint the same thou any more,

*He says he divorced old Barren reason and took the daughter of the Vine to spouse, Have you ever heard a dry say anything that smart,*

I am against Divorces but there was a good legitimate reason and the first divorce case in history,

Not only Omar but all the great men of the past had something on their hip all the time, Caesar carried a canteen of Chianti that would make an Italian Restaurant proprietor envious, Shakespear, history says, when writing always had two bottles in front of him, now you know there was only one of them had Ink in it. He is the originator of the line "Bring on another Flagon of Ale,"

*History says Nero fiddled while Rome burned, Now any man has got to drink to fiddle, and whoever listens to him fiddle has to drink more,*

I have visited Washingtons old home at Mount Vernon, There are glasses in a case there that were never meant to drink water out of, Have a grape orchard there and I know they dident eat that many raisins, a basement down stairs and there were no furnaces in those days, What was in it?

The New York Times gave a prize for the best editorial on the war guess you would think some Teetotalar got it. WELL if Marse Henry Waterson is a total abstainer Mcadoo is a good railroad man,

*The Romans were the first people to discover after Noah any other reason for water, they put it in those beautiful Roman Baths then built marble slabs to lay on and watch it, You never saw a picture of a Roman in the water in your life,*

Look at the mince pie, goodbye to it, We dident kick what all they put in it (and they put everything but mince) but when the old brandy is shy why so long pie,

Speaking of prohibition we played in Baltimore which was wet the week the armistice was signed, Washington was dry, Well Baltimore had such a big celebration and run so short of stuff that they had to send over to Washington for some more,

I had a friend who wanted a drink awful bad when we were in Washington but he couldent borrow a uniform from anybody,

The janitor who cleans up the Senators and Congressmens rooms at the Capitol pays a big price just for the empty bottle privilege,

**The foreign Embassys are supposed to be the only wet spots, If I was a drinking man I would stop at the Oklahoma Embassy while there,**

Big interests used to maintain a lobby with plenty of money there, Now they maintain a bar and get the same results,

Now you often hear a Wall Street man say "It cost me 6 quarts and over 100 cocktails to get that bill through,"

Now Congress says the women can vote, They use to could drink and not vote now they can vote and not drink,

It will take them just as long to make up their minds who to vote for as it did to tell what to order to drink.

Most of them will vote for some guy named Martini just through force of habit,

*If those women think they are going to get as much of a thrill around a voting booth; as they did around the old Punch Bowl they are going to be fooled,*

Thats why the Anti Suffs fought it so hard They knew that the old cocktail served in a teacup at the afternoon tea, carried more real authority than all the primaries ever held,

Prohibition takes all the joy out of voting, Who wants to vote if theres no place to stop on the way home, Besides one has to be about half drunk to vote for most of the candidates they run nowadays.

**If some politicians wait for the sober vote to elect them they are sunk,**

At first its going to feel kinder embarrassing to sell your vote while you are sober,

If they add the cost of the drinks a man used to have to buy while dickering for your vote to the price of the vote, It ought to bring a fellow more real money now than it did,

Votes will be higher as men wont be able to sell them as often as they used to,

In the old days if you could keep the politician who was buying, drinking with you, You could sometimes sell several times to him alone,

And its going to make an awful difference in counting them, More men have lost office through bad counting than through bad political policies,

A man with nothing on his hip but a patch aint liable to mistake one hundred for one thousand,

And if he is sober he aint near as liable to be asked to make said mistake,

A quart of old crow in the counting room at night has put more men in office than voters ever did,

If a man had a drink for every vote that has been torn up, or missplaced he wouldent have to worry about prohibition coming,

They lay all the divorces on to liquor, When its only bad judgement in picking em,

Some men have to drink to live with a woman some women have to drink to live with a man, most generally though they both have to drink to live with each other,

The drys as usual have it just wrong, It wont stop divorces it will stop marriages,

*A couple sitting opposite at a table dont look near so good to each other over a water decanter as they do over two just emptied Champaign glasses,*

Instead of weddings being jolly parties, From now on they are going to be as they should, very solemn affairs,

The old fashioned Justice or Minister that used to be woke up at three in the A M by a couple coming from some gay party wanting to get married, will have to look for some other occupation now,

**If it will only cause better food and shorter speeches at banquets it will make up for all the bad it does,**

And Poetry, they claim liquor is responsible for most all the poetry, and I believe it for it sounded like it,

See we have Russian Boomb throwing, if we have to take it to get that other Russian evil prohibition why I am in favor of giving them both back,

These secret societies will be harder hit by it than anybody, As what they are taking away was their secret,

These reformers are always wanting to save you and if it wasent for them people wouldent need saving,

They cant lay Bolshevism on to booze, As at the late prices none of them could afford to buy it,

**If you saw a man drunk in the old days it was a sign of no will power, But if you see one drunk now its a sure sign of wealth,**

Somebody asked an old cattleman down home where I live if he was going to buy an Automobile (he was only worth a couple of hundred thousand) He said "No I aint, there are men in this county now who own automobiles that havent got a pint of whiskey in their house,

Why not settle this Prohibition FiftyFifty,     Let the Prohibitionists quit drinking,

Any time a dry is up talking just mention one word and he is through,—Russia,

If Pres Wilson wanted to get this League of Nations through he should have taken some Prohibitionists with him they would have showed him how to get it through whether the people wanted it or not,

Some bird name Sheppard put this bill through congress, Leave it to a Texas Sheep herder to crab it,

Turkey is the only other prohibition country in the world, If we enjoyed some of their other privaleges it wouldent be so bad,

**Somebody figured out now that we can have 2 and three quarter percent beer, But who wants to drink 37 and a half bottles to be 100 per cent drunk,**

Well I will jarr loose now, that is about enough of this nonsense, I want to apologize to the drys and say that maby I will write another one on their side and have better arguments, I dont drink and it dont make any difference to me which side I am on,

I get paid for getting laughs and I found out that the majority of the people would laugh more if I kidded the drys,

BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE LAUGH ONE WAY AND VOTE THE OTHER.

LOOK AT CONGRESS IT VOTED DRY AND DRINKS WET.

THE END
